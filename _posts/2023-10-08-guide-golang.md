## Getting Started with Golang (Go)

1. `Installation` Start, by installing the Go programming language on your computer/laptop. You can download the installer from the Go website (`https;//golang.org/dl/`). Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

   ```
   $ mkdir go_hello_world
   $ cd go_hello_world
   $ touch main.go

- example
  ```
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
      fmt.Println("Hello World!")
    }
  ```
