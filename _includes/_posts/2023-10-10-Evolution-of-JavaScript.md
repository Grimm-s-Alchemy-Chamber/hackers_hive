# JavaScript / ECMAScript

**JavaScript**  was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

  

It was developed for **Netscape 2**, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

  

After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was **1.8.5**. (Identical to ES5).

  

**Internet Explorer (IE4)** was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).

 ## From ES4 to ES6

When the TC39 committee got together in Oslo in 2008, to agree on ECMAScript 4, they were divided into 2 very different camps:

**The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp**:  
Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3.

**The ECMAScript 4 Camp**:  
Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade.
The solution was to work together:

-   ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5
-   ES5 should be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3.
-   Features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions.
-   TC39 should develop a new major release, bigger in scope than ES5.
- ------------------------

The planned new release (ES6) was codenamed "Harmony" (Because of the split it created?).

ES5 was a huge success. It was released in 2009, and all major browsers (including Internet Explorer) were fully compliant by July 2013
